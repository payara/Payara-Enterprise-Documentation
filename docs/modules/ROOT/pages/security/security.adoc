= Overview

This section describes how to deal with known or unknown security issues and
common vulnerabilities and exploits (CVEs) related to Payara Server and
Payara Micro.

[[download-security-fixes]]
== Download Security Fixes

Reported security vulnerabilities by the community or Payara Services Limited's
 costumers are patched and released either in specific patch releases
 (for paid support customers exclusively) or quarterly releases. In some
 cases, we might release special hotfixes to the community to patch serious
 vulnerabilities that cannot wait for a quarterly release to be fixed.

To get the specific fix for a reported vulnerability, please download the
specific release that fixed that vulnerability.

[[locating-security-vulnerabilities]]
== Locating Security Vulnerabilities

In order to locate the release a security update has been included for a
specific vulnerability, search in the
xref:/security/security-fix-list.adoc[security fixes summary]
page for the specific vulnerability using its
https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/[CVE identifier].

For each of these security vulnerabilities, a reference to the
_*Pull Requests*_ merged to fix them is given for auditing purposes.
If a security vulnerability has been reported, but is not related or it
doesn't affect Payara Server or Payara Micro in any way, a proper
justification will be detailed in the observations of such vulnerability.
This is done to track reported vulnerabilities and keep users informed
about them.

[[reporting-security-issues]]
== Reporting Security Issues

Payara Services Limited is very active at identifying and fixing possible
security vulnerabilities included into Payara Server and Payara Micro that
are either inherited from GlassFish upstream or introduced by new features
developed.

We strongly encourage users to report such problems in the following ways:

. If you have a support contract, create a ticket describing the security
vulnerabilities detected as you would do for any other bug reports.
. If you do not have a support contract, please send an email with the
described vulnerabilities detected to
mailto:security@payara.fish[security@payara.fish].
*Please don't use this address to report bugs or issues unrelated to security vulnerabilities*
as they will be ignored,  instead use the GitHub repository
https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues[issues page] for raising a new
issue detailing the problem at hand.

[[NOTE]]
====
All networked servers are subject to denial of service
(_DoS_) attacks, and we cannot provide fixes to generic problems
(such as a client streaming lots of data to your server, or re-requesting
the same URL repeatedly). Instead, focus on security issues that can be
targeted at specific topics like session hacking, XSS injection, CSRF attacks
and so forth.
====

Lastly, you can also direct inquiries about reported CVE issues
detected in similar Java platforms or application servers (like Apache
Tomcat, JBoss WildFly, etc.) and let us research whether or not Payara
Server is affected by such issues.
