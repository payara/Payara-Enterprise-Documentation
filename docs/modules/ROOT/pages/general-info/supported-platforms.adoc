= Supported Platforms

Though it is always possible for new versions to be supported, this page
details the JVMs currently supported by the Payara Platform Enterprise (both Payara Server Enterprise and Payara Micro Enterprise).

While not all environments are tested, if it is on a supported JVM we will
provide support for customers and address issues reported by the community.
Similarly, other platforms can always be requested for support.
