# Release Notes - Payara Platform Enterprise 5.32.0

### Supported APIs and Applications
* Jakarta EE 8
* Java EE 8 Applications
* MicroProfile 4.1


#### Breaking Changes

##### Hazelcast 4 Upgrade

Since this Enterprise version contains an upgraded version of Hazelcast, there is no rolling upgrade possible due to the changes within Hazelcast. A domain or set of Payara Micro instances having a mixture of Hazelcast 3.x and Hazelcast 4.x results in errors.

Since the Cluster Password is no longer supported on Hazelcast, the asadmin command `set-hazelcast-configuration` no longer has the optional `--clusterPassword` option.

##### Payara Nexus Repository Changes

The structure of our Payara Nexus server has changed. This means that you might need to change the URLs pointing to the repository in your repository manager, CI environment, or development environment if you make use of the `payara-enterprise` repository.  You can read more details about the change and the new structure in our knowledge base article; https://support.payara.fish/hc/en-gb/articles/4408617212177[Payara Nexus repository changes after October 18th 2021].
