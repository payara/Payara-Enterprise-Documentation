# Cloud Config Sources

The Cloud Config Sources can be used to extract configuration properties from a secret store or a database of several different cloud providers. The following Cloud Config Sources are currently available:

- xref:documentation/microprofile/config/cloud/aws.adoc[AWS Secrets Manager]
- xref:documentation/microprofile/config/cloud/azure.adoc[Azure Secrets]
- xref:documentation/microprofile/config/cloud/dynamo-db.adoc[DynamoDB Database]
- xref:documentation/microprofile/config/cloud/gcp.adoc[GCP Secret Manager]
- xref:documentation/microprofile/config/cloud/hashicorp.adoc[HashiCorp Secrets]

## Configuration

Each of the cloud configuration sources are disabled by default, but can be configured dynamically or statically like any other Payara service. The configuration commands and options can be found in the respective cloud config source page.
