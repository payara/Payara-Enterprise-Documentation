= Eclipse MicroProfile Health Check API

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.181 and 5.181_

Provided version of the API: {mpHealthSpecUrl}[MicroProfile Health Check {mpHealthVersion}]

[[background]]
== Background

The Health Check API was created to allow easier probing of the state of computing nodes with a cloud infrastructure environment.

A full overview for the reasoning behind the API can be found in
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/blob/master/README.adoc[the README for the source code repository.]

{mpHealthSpecUrl}[The complete specification] is maintained in the same repository.

[[rest-endpoints]]
== REST Endpoints

The MicroProfile Healthchecks API defines the following list of REST endpoints that are available from the root context at `/health/${type}` by default:

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|====
|Context
|Type
|Description

|`/health/live`
|Liveness
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Liveness` are performed and the results aggregated.

|`/health/ready`
|Readiness
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Readiness` are performed and the results aggregated.

|'/health/started'
|Startup
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with '@Startup' are performed and the results aggregated.

|`/health`
|Readiness + Liveness + Startup
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Liveness`, `@Readiness`, or `@Startup` are performed and the results aggregated.
|====

This root endpoint can be altered using the `set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration` asadmin command to prevent collisions with other HTTP endpoints that might need to use the `health` context root.

NOTE: This endpoint will not be available until at least one application has been deployed.

[[health-check-configuration]]
== Health Check Configuration

Health Check can be configured by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands. 

_Since *5.183*&nbsp;_

[[using-the-admin-console]]
=== Using the Admin Console

To configure the Health Check in the Admin Console, go to Configuration 
→ [instance-configuration (like server-config)] → MicroProfile → Health Check:

[[using-asadmin-commands]]
=== Using Asadmin Commands

The following administration commands can be used to configure the MicroProfile Healthcheck service:

[[set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration]]
==== `set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration`

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.182 and 5.182_

*Usage*::
----
asadmin set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration 
        [--enabled=true|false]
        [--securityenabled=true|false]
        [--roles=<role-list>] 
        [--endpoint=<context-root[default:health]>] 
        [--target=<target[default:server]>]
        [--virtualservers=<virtualserver-list>]
----
*Aim*::
Enables or disables the MicroProfile healthcheck service and configures the endpoint where all registered health checks are exposed.

IMPORTANT: Changes made with this command will only be applied when the server or instance is restarted.

[[security-configuration]]
=== Security Configuration
By default, HealthCheck endpoints bind to root context application which is 
`__default-web-module` (docroot) system application and `__default-web-module` 
application uses the default realm (`file`) of the server. If user application deployed 
with the empty context-root then the security configuration of the deployed 
application will be shared by HealthCheck endpoints.

[[microprofile-4-upgrade]]
== Upgrading from MicroProfile 3.x to 4.x

MicroProfile 4.0 brings with it a number of changes to MicroProfile Health. The main incompatible change
brought in by this upgrade is the removal of the deprecated `@Health` annotation.

There isn't a workaround for this, the annotation is simply gone: all health checks must be registered as a
`@Readiness`, `@Liveness`, or `@Startup` check.
