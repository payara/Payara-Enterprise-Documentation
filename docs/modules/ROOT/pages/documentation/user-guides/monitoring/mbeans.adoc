[[payara-mbeans]]
== Payara MBeans

These MBeans are part of Payara and provide additional information about current
usage. They are all in the form of
`amx:pp=amx:pp=/mon/server-mon[instance-name],type=type-of-mbean,name=MBeanName`
where `instance-name` is replaced by the name of the instance i.e.
`amx:pp=/mon/server-mon[server],type=web-request-mon,name=web/request`.
See xref:documentation/user-guides/monitoring/enable-jmx-monitoring.adoc#enable-jmx-view[Viewing JMX Monitoring Data]
for how to view all available MBeans.

IMPORTANT: Payara MBeans are only available when AMX is booted. This is done
automatically once a JMX client connects. For all other cases, AMX must be either
configured to boot at server startup (through domain config) or booted via a JMX operation `bootAMX`
on the `amx-support:type=boot-amx` MBean using a non-JMX client (e.g. over a local socket). 
Programmatic activation during application deployment (by means of a Startup EJB singleton for example) will not work.
