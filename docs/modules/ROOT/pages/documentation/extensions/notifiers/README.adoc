= Notifier Extensions

The notifier extensions allow notifications from the Notification Service to propagate to various channels on top of the notifiers provided by default.

You can find the code for each notifier here: https://github.com/payara/Notifiers. The codebase includes a notifier example in case a notifier you want is not available and you'd like to implement it yourself.

== Notifier Summary

Each notifier extension is composed of 2 parts:

### The Core Module

The core module contains all the code necessary to receive notifications from the notification service and propagate them to their proposed channel. When installing this module, you'll get the admin commands to configure the notifier, as well as the ability to select that notifier in the notification sources such as Request Tracing commands and admin console pages.

### The Admin Console Plugin

The admin console plugin contains all the code necessary to configure the notifier in the admin console. This is exclusively the tab in the notification service page. This module is not required for the notifier to function, but makes administrating the notifier easier.

== Installing a Notifier

To install a notifier extension: download the artifacts listed on the notifier documentation page and drop them into the `${GLASSFISH_HOME}/modules` directory of your Payara Server installation. Alternatively, you can build the module straight from the Github repository and drop all JARs from the `target/` directory of the extension into the same installation directory.

You can then restart the server to see your extension activated.

TIP: Make sure that, if the notifier has dependencies in order to run, the dependency artifacts are also in the installation directory. For any extension documented here, the required JAR downloads are listed towards the top of the relevant documentation page.

== Creating a new Notifier

To create a new notifier, start by copying one of the existing notifier modules. To help, the repository contains an example notifier to show you how to create a new one. Make sure that the POM you use extends the `fish.payara.extensions.notifiers:notifiers-parent` POM. This is found in the root of the notifiers repository, and defines the standard plugins required by Payara extensions.
