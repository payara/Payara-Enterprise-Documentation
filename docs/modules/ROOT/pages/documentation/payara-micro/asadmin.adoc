= Running Asadmin Commands

There are scenarios that require customizing the configuration of a Payara Micro
instance beyond what the available options can do.

On these cases, it's possible to execute administration commands on a running
Payara Micro instance directly to alter its configuration.

There are multiple ways that can be used to execute administration commands on
a Payara Micro instance:

. Send the administration commands from a Payara Server's DAS.
. Using the Payara Micro API on bootstrapped instances.
. Prepare scripts with administration commands that are executed either *before*
or *after* the instance bootstraps itself.
