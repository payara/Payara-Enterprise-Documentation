= JCA Support in Payara Micro

_Since Payara 4.1.2.172_

Payara Micro supports the deployment of Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA)
adapters which can enable communication with external services not natively
supported by Payara Micro.

These can include JMS brokers, cloud messaging providers like Amazon SQS or
existing legacy systems. In the case of JMS, for example, Payara Micro can be
used for both inbound and outbound messaging to a JMS broker using a standard
Message Driven Bean (MDB) and can therefore take advantage of pooling behaviour
available to all types of EJB.

== Installing a JCA Adapter

A JCA Resource Archive (RAR) is installed by deploying it to Payara Micro in 
the same way as an application archive (e.g. a WAR) is deployed. The following
shows an example using an ActiveMQ (JMS 1.1) RAR:

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy activemq-rar-5.14.5.rar
----

The connector is subsequently available to all other applications deployed to
Payara Micro. An application using a connector and the connector itself can be
deployed simultaneously:

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy activemq-rar-5.14.5.rar --deploy myapp.war
----

NOTE: When deploying multiple files to Payara Micro, the order of `--deploy`
options is respected so, in the above example, the ActiveMQ RAR wil be deployed
before the `myapp.war` application.
