= Starting an Instance

This section details the very basics of starting a Payara Micro instance.

[[starting-an-instance-from-the-command-line]]
== Starting an Instance from the Command Line

To start an instance of Payara Micro from the command line, you simply run the JAR:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar
----

This single command is all you need to run Payara Micro instances; additional
configuration options are all part of this command.

[[starting-an-instance-from-rootdir-launcher]]
== Starting an Instance from Persistent Configuration Directory

When using xref:documentation/payara-micro/rootdir.adoc[persistent root configuration directory], it is possible to generate a launcher bound to that directory using the command:

[source,shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --outputlauncher --rootdir $rootDirectory
----

This will create file `$rootDirectory/launch-micro.jar` and exit immediately.
After that, it is possible to launch payara with plain

[source,shell]
----
java -jar $rootDirectory/launch-micro.jar
----

This makes configuration directory self-sufficient and the distribution file (`payara-micro.jar`) is no longer needed.

[[starting-an-instance-programmatically]]
== Starting an Instance Programmatically

You need to import two classes from the `fish.payara.micro` package (contained
in the Payara Micro JAR, see section
xref:/documentation/payara-micro/maven/maven.adoc[Maven Support] for
instructions on importing this JAR with **Maven**):

[source,Java]
----
import fish.payara.micro.BootstrapException;
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicro;
----

You can then start an instance with default settings by calling the `bootstrap()`
method from the `PayaraMicro` class. This initialization will throw a
`BootstrapException` exception, so you will need to surround it with a **try-catch**,
or have the parent method throw the exception.

A simple example is as follows:

[source,Java]
----
import fish.payara.micro.BootstrapException;
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicro;

public class EmbeddedPayara{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws BootstrapException{
        PayaraMicro.bootstrap();
    }
}
----

To start an instance with non-default settings (configuration changes or deploying
applications upon startup), you have to call the `getInstance()` method before
using `bootstrap()`. More details on this can be found in the
xref:/documentation/payara-micro/configuring/config-program.adoc[Configuring an Instance Programmatically]
section. The use of the `getInstance()` method does not exclude you from using
the default settings however; calling the `bootstrap()` method on its own (as
shown in the example above) is functionally equivalent to calling the
`bootstrap()` method directly after the `getInstance()` method, such as in the
example below:

[source,Java]
----
import fish.payara.micro.BootstrapException;
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicro;

public class EmbeddedPayara{
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws BootstrapException{
        PayaraMicro.getInstance().bootStrap();
    }
}
----

The `bootStrap()` method returns a `PayaraMicroRuntime` object instance, which
is comes with various methods that afford you control over the instance and its
cluster after you have bootstrapped it. To take advantage of this, you have to
initialize a `PayaraMicroRuntime` object from the `bootStrap` method, like so:

[source,Java]
----
import fish.payara.micro.BootstrapException;
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicro;
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicroRuntime;

public class EmbeddedPayara{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws BootstrapException{
        PayaraMicroRuntime instance = PayaraMicro.bootStrap();
    }
}
----
