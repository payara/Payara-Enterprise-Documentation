This section describes how to shut down a Payara Micro Enterprise instance.

== Stopping an Instance from the Command Line

Payara Micro instances can be stopped by either:

* Using `CTRL-C` on the terminal in which Payara Micro Enterprise is running.
* Sending a kill signal to the process ID of Payara Micro Enterprise

== Stopping an Instance Programmatically

To shut down a Payara Micro instance programmatically, you will need to use the
`shutdown()` method of the `PayaraMicro` or `PayaraMicroRuntime` class.

The `shutdown()` method of the `PayaraMicro` class must be called on the instance
of Payara Micro that you want to shut down, so will realistically only be used
on a `PayaraMicro` instance variable:

[source,Java]
----
import fish.payara.micro.BootstrapException;
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicro;

public class EmbeddedPayara{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws BootstrapException{

        PayaraMicro micro = PayaraMicro.getInstance();
        micro.bootStrap();
        micro.shutdown();
    }
}
----

The `shutdown()` method of the `PayaraMicroRuntime` class is tied to an instance
variable, so is used in much the same way:

[source,Java]
----
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicro;
import fish.payara.micro.BootstrapException;
import fish.payara.micro.PayaraMicroRuntime;

public class EmbeddedPayara{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws BootstrapException{

        PayaraMicroRuntime instance = PayaraMicro.bootstrap();
        instance.shutdown();
    }
}
----
