= Clustering with Payara Server

Payara Micro Enterprise can cluster with Payara Server and share web session and JCache data.

To cluster with Payara Server, just start a Payara Micro Enterprise instance using `--clustermode domain:ip:port`.

When Payara Server DAS is connected to the same Hazelcast cluster, the Admin
console can display the details about Payara Micro instances in the cluster.
See xref:/documentation/payara-server/hazelcast/viewing-members.adoc[Viewing Cluster Members]
section for details.
