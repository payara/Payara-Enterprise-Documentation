= Payara Micro Instance Names

Payara Micro instances are automatically assigned a name on boot. These names
are generated from a dictionary of adjectives and fish names as `adjective-fish`.
For example: `Magnanimous-Payara`, `Disgruntled-Goldfish`, and `Bamboozled-Tetra`.

== Setting a Custom Instance Name

Instance names can be overridden with the `--name` command-line argument on start-up.
Manually entered instances names are non-unique.

As an example, see below:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --name MicroInstance1
----
