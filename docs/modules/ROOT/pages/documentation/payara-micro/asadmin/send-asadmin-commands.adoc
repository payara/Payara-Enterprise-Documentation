= Sending Asadmin Commands to Payara Micro from a Domain Administration Server

Asadmin commands can be sent from the Domain Administration Server (DAS) to
Payara Micro Enterprise instances that are running within the same data grid as the DAS.

Since *5.184*, `stop-domain` can also be issued to a Payara Micro Enterprise instance.

This can be achieved either using the admin console or from the command line.

== Sending Asadmin Commands using the Admin Console

Sending an Asadmin command is performed through the Domain Data Grid. This
Data Grid is powered by Hazelcast and is enabled by default. You can verify if it
active by looking under the _server-config_ configuration under the _Data Grid_ item.

All the members can be seen under the _Data Grid_ entry of the Domain item on the left menu.
At the bottom of the page, you will find a table filled with the
Payara Micro instances:

== Sending Asadmin Commands from the Command Line

To send administration commands using the command line there is a new `asadmin`
command for the Domain Administration Server - `send-asadmin-command`.
The asadmin command is entered using the `--command` option, which only accepts
a single command as an input (including said commands own arguments).

As an example of sending a command from the command line:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin send-asadmin-command --command deploy /home/user/application --contextRoot=/example
----
