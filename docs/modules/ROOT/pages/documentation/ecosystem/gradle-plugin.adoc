|Element
|Default
|Notes

|`useUberJar`
|false
|Use created uber-jar that resides in target folder. The name of the JAR
artifact will be resolved automatically by evaluating its final name, artifact
ID and version. This configuration element has the higher precedence compared to
`payaraMicroAbsolutePath` and `payaraVersion`.

|`payaraMicroAbsolutePath`
|_none_
|Absolute path to payara-micro executable.

|`payaraVersion`
|{currentVersion}
|By default `microStart` task fetches Payara Micro with version {currentVersion}.

|`daemon`
|false
|Starts Payara Micro in separate JVM process and continues with the gradle build.

|`immediateExit`
|false
|If Payara Micro is executed in daemon mode, the executor thread will wait for
the ready message before shutting down its process. By setting `immediateExit`
to `true` you can skip this and instantly interrupt the executor thread.

|`javaPath`
|`java`
|Absolute path to the java executable.

|`deployWar`
|false
|If the attached project is of type WAR, it will automatically be deployed to
Payara Micro if `deployWar` is set to `true`.

|`javaCommandLineOptions`
|_none_
|Defines a list of command line options that will be passed to `java` executable.
Command line options can either be defined as key-value pairs or just as list of
values. key-value pairs will be formatted as `key=value`.

|`commandLineOptions`
|_none_
|Defines a list of command line options that will be passed onto Payara Micro.

=== `microStop`
*Aim*: This task stops Payara Micro with the specified configuration. 
By default this goal tries to find out currently executing Payara Micro instance based on project GAV.
If `processId` is defined, it will take precedence and the given `processId` will
immediately kill the executing Payara Micro instance.

*Usage*: `gradle microStop`
