= Cloud Connectors

The Payara Cloud Connectors are a collection of JCA adapters for use with
various popular cloud messaging providers. These connectors can be deployed to
Payara Server Enterprise or Payara Micro Enterprise version 172 or higher.

The available connectors are:

* xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/apache-kafka.adoc[Apache Kafka]
* xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/amazon-sqs.adoc[Amazon SQS]
* xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/mqtt.adoc[MQTT]
* xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/azure-sb.adoc[Azure Service Bus]

== Obtaining the connectors

Cloud connectors are currently not available in binary form, but have to be
built from source as follows:

Clone the https://github.com/payara/Cloud-Connectors[Cloud-Connectors] git repository:

----
git clone git@github.com:payara/Cloud-Connectors.git
----

Build and install the connectors:

----
cd Cloud-Connectors/
mvn clean install
----

The connectors can be found in the following locations as JCA rars:

* Kafka -  ./Kafka/KafkaRARPackaging/target/KafkaRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar
* Amazon SQS - ./AmazonSQS/AmazonSQSRAR/target/AmazonSQSRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar
* MQTT - ./MQTT/MQTTRAR/target/MQTTRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar
* Azure Service Bus - ./AzureServiceBus/AzureSBRAR/target/AzureSBRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar

[[Installing-a-connector]]
== Installing a connector
A connector (JCA rar) is installed by deploying it to Payara Micro in the same
way as an application archive (e.g. a .war) is deployed. The following shows an
example:

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --deploy KafkaRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar
----

The connector is subsequently available to all other applications deployed to
Payara Micro. An application using a connector and the connector itself can be
deployed simultaneously:

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --deploy KafkaRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar --deploy myapp.war
----

== Securing credentials

In the documentation pages for the currently available cloud connectors,
much of the configuration shown is done via annotations. This configuration
contains credentials as well, which as a rule of thumb should not directly be
placed in code. On Payara all properties can be replaced via System properties
using the syntax ${system.property.name} or environment variables using the
syntax `${ENV=evironment.property.name}` or password aliases using the syntax
`${ALIAS=alias.name}`.
