= MQTT Cloud Connector

MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)  is a lightweight publish-subscribe
messaging protocol.

In order to connect to a MQTT broker, the `MQTTRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar` has to
be deployed as shown in the xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/README.adoc#Installing-a-connector[
Installing a connector section] of the Cloud Connectors overview.

In order to make use of this connector in an application, the following maven
dependency is needed:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.cloud.connectors.mqtt</groupId>
  <artifactId>MQTT-JCA-API</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Note that this dependency have scope provided since the types within this
dependency are globally available to every application deployed to Payara Micro
after the `MQTTRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar`  was deployed.

== Sending messages
Sending messages to a MQTT broker can be done via the JCA and an MQTT specific
API. In order to start using this API to send messages, a resource has to be
defined via the JCA API; a connection factory.

The connection factory has to be given a name, which can be any name that is
valid for JNDI. The `java:app` namespace is typically recommended to be used.
The type of the connection factory to be used for MQTT is 
`fish.payara.cloud.connectors.mqtt.api.MQTTConnectionFactory`, and we have to
specify the resource adapter name which is here `MQTTRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar`.

The following gives an example:

[source,Java]
----
@ConnectionFactoryDefinition ( 
 name = "java:app/mqtt/factory",
 interfaceName = "fish.payara.cloud.connectors.mqtt.api.MQTTConnectionFactory",
 resourceAdapter = "MQTTRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
 properties = "cleanSession=true")
)
----

With the above shown definition in place the following code shows an example of
sending a message:

[source,Java]
----
@Singleton
@Startup
public class SendMQTTMessage {
 
 @Resource(lookup = "java:app/mqtt/factory")
 private MQTTConnectionFactory factory;
 
 @PostConstruct
 public void init() {
    try (MQTTConnection connection = factory.createConnection()) {
        connection.publish("test", "{\"test\": \"Hello World\"}".getBytes(), 0, false);
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
    }
  }
}
----


== Receiving messages
Messages can be received from an MQTT broker by creating an MDB (Message Driven
Bean) that implements the `fish.payara.cloud.connectors.mqtt.api.MQTTListener`
marker interface and has a single method annotated with `@OnMQTTMessage` and the
method signature `void method(String topic, MqttMessage message)`.

The following gives an example:

[source,Java]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "topicFilter", propertyValue = "test") 
})
public class ReceiveMQTTMessage implements MQTTListener {
   @OnMQTTMessage
   public void receiveMessage(String topic, MqttMessage message) {
       // Handle message
   }
}
