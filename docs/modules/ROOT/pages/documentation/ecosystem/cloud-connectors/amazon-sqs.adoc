= Amazon SQS Cloud Connector

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a hosted and highly scalable distributed
message queue.

In order to connect to Amazon SQS, the `AmazonSQSRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar` has to
be deployed as shown in the xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/README.adoc#Installing-a-connector[
Installing a connector section] of the Cloud Connectors overview.

Once deployed, something like the following should be printed to the startup log
of Payara Micro:

----
[fish.payara.cloud.connectors.amazonsqs.api.inbound.AmazonSQSResourceAdapter] [tid: _ThreadID=1 _ThreadName=main] [timeMillis: 1495398495490] [levelValue: 800] Amazon SQS Resource Adapter Started..
----

In order to make use of this connector in an application, the following two
maven dependencies are needed:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.cloud.connectors.amazonsqs</groupId>
  <artifactId>AmazonSQSJCAAPI</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
  <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-sqs</artifactId>
  <version>1.11.118</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Note that these dependences have scope provided since the types within this
dependency are globally available to every application deployed to Payara Micro
after the `AmazonSQSRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar` was deployed.

== Sending messages
Sending messages to Amazon SQS can be done via the JCA and an Amazon specific
API. In order to start using this API to send messages, a resource has to be
defined via the JCA API; a connection factory.

The connection factory has to be given a name, which can be any name that is
valid for JNDI. The `java:app` namespace is typically recommended to be used.
The type of the connection factory to be used for Amazon SQS is 
`fish.payara.cloud.connectors.amazonsqs.api.AmazonSQSConnectionFactory`, and we
have to specify the resource adapter name which is here
`AmazonSQSRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar`.

Finally the AWS account details have to be specified.

The following gives an example:

[source,Java]
----
@ConnectionFactoryDefinition ( 
 name = "java:app/amazonsqs/factory",
 interfaceName = "fish.payara.cloud.connectors.amazonsqs.api.AmazonSQSConnectionFactory",
 resourceAdapter = "AmazonSQSRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
 properties = {"awsAccessKeyId=<your amazon access key>", "awsSecretKey=<your amazon secret key>", "region=eu-west-2"})
)
----

With the above shown definition in place the following code shows an example of sending a message:

[source,Java]
----
@Singleton
@Startup
public class SendSQSMessage {
 
 @Resource(lookup = "java:app/amazonsqs/factory")
 private AmazonSQSConnectionFactory factory;
 
 @PostConstruct
 public void init() {
    try (AmazonSQSConnection connection = factory.createConnection()) {
        connection.sendMessage(new SendMessageRequest("queueURL", "Hello World"));
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
    }
 }  
}
----

== Receiving messages
Messages can be received from Amazon SQS by creating an MDB (Message Driven
Bean) that implements the `fish.payara.cloud.connectors.amazonsqs.api.AmazonSQSListener`
marker interface and has a single method annotated with `@OnSQSMessage` and the
method signature `void method(Message message)`.

The following gives an example:

[source,Java]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "awsAccessKeyId", propertyValue = "someKey"),
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "awsSecretKey", propertyValue = "someSecretKey"),
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "queueURL", propertyValue = "someQueueURL"), 
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "pollInterval", propertyValue = "1"), 
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "region", propertyValue = "eu-west-2") 
})
public class ReceiveSQSMessage implements AmazonSQSListener {

 @OnSQSMessage
 public void receiveMessage(Message message) {
     // Handle message
 }
}
----
