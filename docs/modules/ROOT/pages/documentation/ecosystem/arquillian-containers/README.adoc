== Obtaining the Containers

Arquillian containers are included in a project via their Maven coordinates:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>fish.payara.arquillian</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-payara-${container-name}</artifactId>
    <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Some containers will be either in development or an early release version. In these cases
the same process can be used, but the artifact will need to be built from source.
The containers can be found in the Payara Arquillian source code repository.
