5. In the last step you can select resources which will be deployed on the server.
  Here we don't have any deployable projects in the workspace yet, so both panels are empty.

5. If the deployment was successful, you can use the application.
  Here we simply opened the internal Eclipse's browser and sent the HTTP GET request - and the application responded.
