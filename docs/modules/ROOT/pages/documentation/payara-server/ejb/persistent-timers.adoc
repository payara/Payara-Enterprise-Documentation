= Persistent EJB Timers on the Domain Data Grid

_Since Payara Server 5.181_

It is possible to persist an EJB Timer to the Domain Data Grid rather than to a database. The same feature is standard in xref:/documentation/payara-micro/persistent-ejb-timers.adoc[Payara Micro].

Persisting an EJB Timer to the Domain Data Grid means that the Data Grid itself will store the timer details, preserving it even if the original instance leaves the cluster.

IMPORTANT: All stored timers are lost if the whole domain is stopped.

The Persistence service for EJB Timers can be set in the administration console by navigating to the *EJB Timer Service* tab in the EJB Container node of a configuration.

To use the Data Grid to store EJB Timers set the *Persistence Service* to _DataGrid_

EJB Timers will be coordinated across a single deployment group and if an instance of the deployment group is stopped another instance in the same deployment group will take ownership of the timer and ensure it is fired.

CAUTION: Clustered Timer Firing Mode is NOT used in this version of Payara Server and is always "One Per Deployment Group"

It is also possible to set the `ejb-timer-service` from the command line. To get the current state, run the following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> get configs.config.${your-config}.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service
----

This will return the current state taken from the _domain.xml_ configuration file, which by default should be something similar to the following:

[source, bash]
----
asadmin> get configs.config.server-config.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service

configs.config.server-config.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service.ejb-timer-service=Database
configs.config.server-config.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service.max-redeliveries=1
configs.config.server-config.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service.minimum-delivery-interval-in-millis=1000
configs.config.server-config.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service.redelivery-interval-internal-in-millis=5000
Command get executed successfully.
----

To persist to the DataGrid you need only change the value for `configs.config.server-config.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service.ejb-timer-service` to `DataGrid`. To do this, run the following `set` command:

[source, bash]
----
asadmin> set configs.config.server-config.ejb-container.ejb-timer-service.ejb-timer-service=DataGrid
----

WARNING: `set` commands are not dynamic. You will need to restart your domain to apply the changes.

[[timer-migration]]
== Timer Migration

EJB Timers stored in the Domain Data Grid support timer migration between Instances in the same Deployment Group. You can migrate timers using the Administration console from the *Deployment Group* page. Timers can also be migrated between instances using asadmin commands like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> migrate-timers --target server1 server2
----

Where `server1` is the active instance to migrate timers to and `server2` is the failed instance.
