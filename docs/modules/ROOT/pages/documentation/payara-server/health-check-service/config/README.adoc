= HealthCheck Service Configuration

As with any other services available in Payara Server Enterprise, the HealthCheck service
can be configured by using the web console, administration commands or editing
the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

[[using-the-web-console]]
== Using the Web Administration Console

To configure the HealthCheck Service in the Administration Console, go to
_Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Healthcheck_:

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to
restart the domain) to switch the HealthCheck service on.

The general settings of the service are:

**Threshold Unit**:: This defines the time duration per unit. The accepted options are any
valid
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html[java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit]
values. The default value is _SECONDS_.
**Threshold Value**:: This defines the number of units beyond which a request
will be traced.
**Store Historic Traces**:: When present, enables the storage of the slowest
historical request trace events.
**Historic Trace Store Size**:: Determines the number of historical trace events that
can be stored in memory when historical storing is enabled. The default value is
**20** records

Aside from this configuration settings, you can also define which notifiers will be
used to relay the HealthCheck events by moving them to the **Active Notifiers**
box.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that for HealthCheck events to be relayed to the
active notifiers, both the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification Service]
and each respective notifier must be enabled first.

TIP: You don't need to manually add each notifier on this screen. When enabling
a notifier on its configuration screen, the server will **automatically** add it to the list
of active notifiers for the HealthCheck service. This same result occurs when
enabling the notifier using the appropriate _asadmin_ command.

NOTE: Configuring active notifiers for the HealthCheck service is a feature
available from _Payara Server 4.1.2.172_ onwards.

[[configuring-the-available-checkers]]
=== Configuring the Available Checkers

Each of the available checkers that are used to determine the server's health can
also be configured separately from each other on the admin console. The list of
the available checkers is as follows:

*CPU Usage*:: Calculates the CPU usage and prints out the percentage along with
the usage time.
*Connection Pool*:: Calculates the ratio of free/used connections available for
all JDBC connections pool an prints the percentage of used connections for each
active pool.
*Heap Memory Usage*:: Calculates the heap memory usage and prints out the percentage
along with initial and committed heap sizes.
*Machine Memory Usage*:: Calculates the machine memory usage and prints
out the percentage along with the total and used physical memory size.
*Hogging Threads*:: Identifies the threads that are hogging the CPU.
*Stuck Threads*:: Identifies the threads that are stuck for a specified period of time.
*Garbage Collector*:: Calculates and prints out how many times GC is executed with
its elapsed time.

You can configure the settings for each checker on the respective tab in the web
console. Here's a sample image with the current configuration for the *CPU Usage* checker:

[[from-the-command-line]]
== From the Command Line

You can configure the HealthCheck Service by using the asadmin commands
documented on the xref:documentation/payara-server/health-check-service/asadmin-commands.adoc[corresponding section]
