= Types of variable references

[[references-to-system-properties]]
== References to System Properties

_Since GlassFish Open Source Edition 4.0_

Variable references to system properties start with `${`, followed by the name
of the variable, and end with `}`. An example of a variable reference that
refers to a `java.home` system property is:

------------
${java.home}
------------

Values of system properties can be specified by:

* the JVM (standard JVM properties like `java.home`)
* Payara Server (a set of predefined variables, such as
`com.sun.aas.instanceRoot`)
* the `create-system-properties` asadmin command (or in the Admin
console `System properties` section)
* a JVM option prefixed with `-D`

When custom properties are specified, their value can also contain other
variable references. It is therefore possible to define a system
property using other system properties or environment variables.

[[references-to-environment-variables]]
== References to environment variables

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.171_

Environment variable references are used like system property references,
but contain an extra `ENV` qualifier and equals sign before the variable name.
An example of a reference to an environment variable `HOME` then looks like:

------------------------------
${ENV=HOME}
${ENV=MAYBE_AVAILABLE:default}
------------------------------

Environment variables need to be specified in the environment before a
Payara instance is started. By adding a colon after the variable name,
you may append a default value if the variable has not been set.

[[password-aliases]]
== References to password aliases

References to password aliases are used to refer to a password which is stored securely in the domain's keystore. They are treated in a special way and cannot be mixed with other variable references and with other characters in the same configuration value. They are only supposed to be used as a value anywhere a password is expected in the configuration.

Password aliases look like system property references, but contain an extra `ALIAS` qualifier and equals sign before the alias name. Whenever used, the configuration value can only contain a password alias and nothing more.

An example of a reference to a password alias called `cluster-password` for an attribute `admin-password` looks like:

------
admin-password="${ALIAS=cluster-password}"
------

[[references-to-microprofile-properties]]
== References to MicroProfile Properties

_Since Payara Server 5.184_

MicroProfile property references can be used exactly like an environment
variable reference, but using the `MPCONFIG` qualifier.
An example of a reference to a MicroProfile property called `foo` would look like:

-----------------------
${MPCONFIG=foo}
${MPCONFIG=bar:default}
-----------------------

MicroProfile properties need to be declared in one of the Payara defined
xref:/documentation/microprofile/config/README.adoc#config-sources[config sources].
By adding a colon after the property name, you may append a default value if
the property has not been set.
