= Network Listeners
:toc:

A network listener is a listen socket that has an IP address, port number, protocol,
as well as various other configuration options. A listener can listen on a specific
port on all network interfaces by using the IP `0.0.0.0`, and a configured port.
A virtual server will then be used to select a combination of network listeners to
use for an application. For example, Payara Server Enterprise has two default network listeners
for user deployed applications: an insecure listener on port 8080 (`http-listener-1`),
and a secure listener on port 8181 (`http-listener-2`).

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

NOTE: When configuring network listeners from the admin console, there are some visible
configuration options that transparently configure the protocol being used. If a
configuration property isn't shown here but is visible in the admin console, see the page
on xref:protocols.adoc[protocols].

Existing network listeners can be configured from the admin console or with asadmin
commands. The network listener configurations can be found in the admin console under
*Configurations* -> *your-config* -> *Network Config* -> *Network Listeners*.

The following fields can be configured for network listeners:

---
[[configuration-name]]
=== Name

The unique name of the network listener. This cannot be edited from the admin console.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.name=value`

---
[[configuration-protocol]]
=== Protocol

The protocol used by the network listener. This cannot be edited from the admin console.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.protocol=${protocol-name}`

---
[[configuration-status]]
=== Status

The status of the network listener. This determines whether the listener will be actively listening for requests.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.status=[true/false]`

---
[[configuration-jk-listener]]
=== JK Enabled

Whether `mod_jk` support should be enabled for this listener. Should only be enabled if `mod_jk` is being
explicitly configured on an Apache Web Server in conjunction with Payara Server Enterprise.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.jk-enabled=[true/false]`

---
[[configuration-jk-config-file]]
==== JK Configuration File

The location of the `mod_jk` configuration file. Defaults to `${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/glassfish-jk.properties`.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.jk-configuration-file=/location/to/file`

---
[[configuration-port]]
=== Port

The port used by the network listener. The selected port will be used to listen for requests.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.port=value`

---
[[configuration-address]]
=== Address

The address used by the network listener. `0.0.0.0` corresponds to all addresses.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.address=value`

---
[[configuration-transport]]
=== Transport

The transport used by the network listener. This cannot be edited from the admin console. Defaults to `tcp`.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.transport=${transport-name}`

---
[[configuration-thread-pool]]
=== Thread Pool

The thread pool used by the network listener. This determines the pool of threads used to service requests.

*Asadmin Command:*

`set configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.${network-listener-name}.thread-pool=${thread-pool-name}`

---
[[asadmin]]
== Asadmin Commands

The following asadmin commands are available for administering network listeners instead of using the admin console.
The parameters are all explained in the configuration options above.

=== create-network-listener

The `create-network-listener` command creates a network listener. It requires an already created transport and protocol.
For more information on creating protocols, see xref:protocols.adoc[protocols]. The parameters are all explained
in the configuration options above.

==== Format
----
asadmin> create-network-listener [--help]
           [--address address]
           --listenerport listener-port
           [--threadpool thread-pool]
           --protocol protocol
           [--transport transport]
           [--enabled={true|false}]
           [--jkenabled={false|true}]
           [--target target]
           listener-name
----


=== restart-http-listeners


The `restart-http-listeners` commands restarts all HTTP listeners but the `admin-listener` of the targeted instance(s).
It is either used with the `--all` flag to target all instances or with a particular target instance, deployment group or cluster following the `--target` parameter.
When `target` and `all` parameters are both omitted the default target is the DAS.
When `--all` is used together with a target the target is ignored and the command affects all instances.
NOTE: This command only restarts all HTTP listeners except the `admin-listener`. IIOP listeners are not affected and may require a server restart to make changes take effect.

==== Format
----
asadmin> restart-http-listeners [--all] [--target target]
----

==== Examples
----
asadmin> restart-http-listeners --all
asadmin> restart-http-listeners --target FlyingFish
asadmin> restart-http-listeners FlyingFish
asadmin> restart-http-listeners
----
First line affects all instances, second line affects only instance named `FlyingFish`, third is a short hand for the second, last is a short hand for `restart-http-listeners server` or `restart-http-listeners --target=server`.
