= Virtual Servers
:toc:

A virtual server is an object that allows one physical server instance to appear
as many. In some ways it is analogous to a network card on a PC: if you have
multiple network cards, the network will consider them as two separate hosts
despite them being part of one. Virtual Servers do the same thing to your
servers, which means for example you could have multiple domain names
(not administrative domains) associated with the same server.

When deploying an application, you have the option to deploy to a specific
Virtual Server, which will have multiple network listeners associated with it.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

Existing virtual servers can be configured from the admin console or with `set`
asadmin commands. The virtual server configurations can be found in the admin
console under *Configurations* -> *your-config* -> *Virtual Servers*.

The following fields can be configured:

---
[[id]]
=== ID
The unique ID for the virtual server. The only field which cannot be altered
from the admin console. The ID cannot begin with a number.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.id=value`


---
[[hosts]]
=== Hosts
A comma separated list of values allowed in the `host` request header to select
this virtual server. Each virtual server with the same connection group must
have a unique host for that group.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.hosts=value,value2`


---
[[state]]
=== State
The enabled state of the virtual server. There are 3 options for this property:

 - *On* -> This means that the virtual server is active and will be ready to
 serve requests.
 - *Off* -> This means that the virtual server is inactive, and will return a
 404 error for all requests made through it. This will look from the outside
 as if no applications are deployed to this server.
 - *Disabled* -> This means that the virtual server is inactive, and will return
 a 403 error for all requests made through it. This will look from the outside
 as if the server is intentionally down for maintenence.


**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.state=on/off/disabled`


---
[[sso]]
=== SSO
Allows multiple web applications deployed to the same virtual server to share
the user authentication state.  This would mean that signing into one
application would implicitly sign you into all of the others.
There are 3 options for this property:

 - *True* (enabled) -> This enables SSO for applications on the same virtual
 server.
 - *False* (disabled) -> This disables SSO for applications on the same virtual
 server.
 - *Inherit* (controlled by HTTP service) -> This will inherit from the value
 specified in the *HTTP Service*.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.sso-enabled=true/false/inherit`


---
[[sso-cookie-http-only]]
=== SSO Cookie Http Only
Determines whether to add the `HttpOnly` flag to the `JSESSIONIDSSO` cookie.
In practice, this will disallow JavaScript access to the cookie in the browser.
This prevents malicious XSS attacks hijacking a Java session. It is enabled by
default.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.sso-cookie-http-only=true/false`


---
[[network-listeners]]
=== Network Listeners
Comma separated list of network listeners which applications deployed to this
virtual server are available on.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.network-listeners=listener-1,listener-2`


---
[default-web-module]
=== Default Web Module
This defines which application deployed to this virtual server will be requested
if no modules are resolved in the request. For example if `app1` and `app2`
have context roots of `/app1` and `/app2` respectively, `app1` will be returned
when the user requests `/`.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.default-web-module=app1`


---
[[log-file]]
=== Log File
This defines a file where log messages coming from this virtual server are
redirected to. This allows you to separate application logs from server logs.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.log-file=/dir/to/logs/file.log`


---
[[docroot]]
=== Docroot
This defines the directory used as the document root for this virtual server.
A document root is a directory where static files can be placed and served from.
For example, if you have a web application deployed to `http://localhost:8080/app1`
and the corresponding virtual server has a docroot value of `/opt/server/docs`,
then requesting `http://localhost:8080/app1/img.jpg` will fetch the file at
`/opt/server/docs/img.jpg`.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.docroot=/dir/to/docs/`


---
[[access-logging]]
==== Access Logging
Enables access logging for this virtual server. Access logging logs all requests
made to that virtual server.
There are 3 options for this property:

 - *True* (enabled) -> This enables access logging for applications on the same
 virtual server.
 - *False* (disabled) -> This disables access logging for applications on the
 same virtual server.
 - *Inherit* (controlled by HTTP service) -> This will inherit from the value
 specified in the *HTTP Service*.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.access-logging=true/false/inherit`


---
[[access-log-directory]]
=== Access Log Directory
Defines the directory used for access logs.

**Asadmin Command:**

`set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.${virtual-server-name}.access-log=/dir/to/logs`


---
[[additional-properties]]
=== Additional properties
Defines additional properties for the configuration of a virtual server.
