= Compression of log files on rotation

_Since version 4.1.1.164_

Both Payara Server and GlassFish 4.0 Open Source Edition provide an option
to rotate logs files using a configurable interval (given either by the size of
the log file or by time elapsed). On top of that, Payara Server Enterprise can be
configured to compress rotated files automatically. This is done
transparently, so  it is still possible to view  log entries that are using the
the log viewer in the Web Admin Console.

== Using the Web Admin Console

When log rotation is configured, you can turn on compression of rotated
files in the `Logger Settings` section, by ticking the `Compress on Rotation`
checkbox:

[[using-asadmin-utility]]
== Using an `asadmin` command

Use the following command to enable or disabled the automatic compression
of log files on rotation:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.compressOnRotation='true'
----

== View the log files in the Admin Console

The log files can be viewed in Admin Console in the same way as if they
were uncompressed. The only difference is that the filename name ends with
the `.gz` extension and it takes much longer to open them and display their
contents.

This is an example how the *Log Viewer* may visualize 3 compressed
log files:
