Logging
-------

Payara Server Enterprise captures information about events that occur and records this
information using its logging mechanism into log files.

In a Payara Server domain, the information is logged into the following files
by default:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==========================================================
|Instance |Log File Name and Location
|Domain Admin Server (DAS) |`domain-dir/logs/server.log`
|Standalone server instance |`instance-dir/logs/server.log`
|Cluster instance |`instance-dir/logs/cluster.log`
|==========================================================

If an instance is started using `-verbose` option, the instance keeps
running in the foreground and also logs information into the console.

Payara Server uses Java Logging (JUL) to format and output log records.
The default configuration file is
`domain-dir/config/logging.properties`.

Logging can be configured by `asadmin` commands (`set-log-attributes`,
`set-log-file-format`, `set-log-levels`, `delete-log-levels`, ...). It
can also be configured in Web Admin Console, in `Configurations`, under
the section `Logger Settings` - as on the following picture:
