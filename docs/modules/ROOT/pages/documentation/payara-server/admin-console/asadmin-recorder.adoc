[[asadmin-recorder]]
= Asadmin Recorder

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.162_

This feature allows you to record the actions you take in the admin
console as asadmin commands, aiding with automating or reproducing your
setup across multiple Payara Server installations.

[[starting-and-stopping-the-asadmin-recorder]]
== Starting and Stopping the Asadmin Recorder

From the admin console, you should be able to see a button labelled
_Enable Asadmin Recorder_ or _Disable Asadmin Recorder_, depending on
whether or not the asadmin recorder feature is enabled or not. Clicking
this button will enable or disable the asadmin recorder feature
respectively:

image:recorder/enable-recorder.png[Enable recorder in Web Console]

image:recorder/disable-recorder.png[Disable recorder in Web Console]

Once enabled, actions in the admin console that have a corresponding
`asadmin` command will be recorded to a file. By default, this file is
located in the domain directory, and is called _asadmin-commands.txt_.

Once enabled or disabled, the asadmin recorder will remain
enabled/disabled until specifically enabled or disabled again through
the web console or using the appropriate asadmin command. This means that the
asadmin recorder will remain enabled or disabled across server restarts.

You can also enable or disable the asadmin recorder on its configuration
page (detailed in the following section), or by using the following asadmin commands:

`enable-asadmin-recorder`:: Enables the asadmin recorder.
`disable-asadmin-recorder`:: Disables the asadmin recorder.
`set-asadmin-recorder-configuration --enabled true`:: Alternative way
of enabling the asadmin recorder.
`set-asadmin-recorder-configuration --enabled false`:: Alternative way
of disabling the asadmin recorder.

== Configuring the Asadmin Recorder

To configure the asadmin recorder, navigate to the following page in the
admin console: _server -> Asadmin Recorder_:

image:recorder/recorder-config.png[Asadmin recorder configuration]

You will be presented with the following configuration options:

_Enabled_:: Sets whether the asadmin recorder service should be
enabled or disabled.
_Filter Commands_:: Sets whether or not to exclude the `asadmin`
commands and regular expressions listed in the _Filtered Commands_
setting from being recorded.
_Output Location_:: The absolute file path for the `asadmin` commands to
be written to. This defaults to a file called _asadmin-commands.txt_ in
the domain directory.
_Filtered Commands_:: A comma separated list of asadmin commands and
regular expressions to be excluded from being recorded if the _Filter Commands_
option is enabled.

The default regular expressions and asadmin commands set in the
_Filtered Commands_ option are a selection of commands and regular
expressions that are typically not needed for any automation purposes,
yet are still sometimes called by commands and through navigation of the
admin console. If you remove any of these commands from the filtered
commands list, or choose not to filter any commands at all, the asadmin
commands script is liable to get filled up with these commands. Due to
this behavior, it is advised that you only add to this list, only removing the
defaults if you really need to.

Be sure to click on the _Save_ button to have any changes you make take
effect.

In addition to using the admin console, you can configure the asadmin
recorder service using the `set-asadmin-recorder-configuration` command.
The command takes the following parameters:

`--enabled`:: Enables or Disables the Asadmin Recorder service.
`--outputLocation`:: Specifies the absolute file path of where the
recorded asadmin commands will be written to.
`--filterCommands`:: Specifies whether or not the commands specified
with the _--filteredcommands_ option should be excluded from being
recorded or not.
`--filteredCommands`:: A comma separated list of asadmin commands and
regular expressions to exclude from being recorded.

As an example, the following will enable the asadmin recorder, set the
output location to _/home/user/asadmin-commands.txt_, and prevent the
`start-instance` command from being recorded (in addition to the
default configuration):

[source, shell]
----
asadmin set-asadmin-recorder-configuration --enabled true --outputLocation /home/user/asadmin-commands.txt --filterCommands true --filteredCommands "version,_(.*),list(.*),get(.*),uptime,enable-asadmin-recorder,disable-asadmin-recorder,set-asadmin-recorder-configuration,asadmin-recorder-enabled,start-instance"
----
