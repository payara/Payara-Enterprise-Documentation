[[configuring-hazelcast]]
= Configuring the Domain Data Grid underlying Hazelcast
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

Payara Server supports configuring Hazelcast through the Admin Console and
asadmin commands. The Hazelcast configuration file can also be directly edited,
but will not be covered in depth in this section.

Configuration of Hazelcast is divided into four sections. The first section 
applies to the whole domain, the second section applies to specific configurations 
and therefore to Payara Server instances that use that configuration, the 
third section covers how certain settings can be specified when a domain is created
and the final section covers how to configure config specific Data Grid Start Port 
during or after the creation of an instance.

Using a Hazelcast configuration file will cause the settings set via the Admin
Console and _asadmin_ commands to be ignored. Any parameters not specified in
the configuration file reverting to the Hazelcast defaults, even if they are
specified in the Admin Console or _domain.xml_ (Note - the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-default.xml[Hazelcast defaults]
are not necessarily the same as the Payara Hazelcast defaults).

NOTE: Since 4.1.2.172 Payara Server uses its
https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/master/nucleus/payara-modules/hazelcast-bootstrap/src/main/java/fish/payara/nucleus/hazelcast/PayaraHazelcastSerializer.java[own serializer]
instead of the default Hazelcast one. Setting a global serializer will not override it.
This was created to avoid a https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/759[bug]
that causes `ClassNotFoundException` errors.



[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file]]
== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File

Hazelcast configuration file can be either set using Admin Console or asadmin CLI.

[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file-admin-console]]
=== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File with the Admin Console

To set the Hazelcast configuration from a Hazelcast Configuration file:

. Select the domain Data Grid configuration from the page tree and click the
*Configuration* tab to view the _"Hazelcast Configuration"_ page:

. On the _Hazelcast Configuration_ page, add the path to your Hazelcast
Configuration file and click "Save". This path is relative to your domain
configuration directory:

[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file-asadmin]]
=== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File using asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` command can be used to set the configuration
file:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --hazelcastconfigurationfile /path/to/file
----

As with the admin console, this path is relative to your domain configuration
directory.

[[configuring-domain-wide-hazelcast-with-the-admin-console]]
== Configuring Domain Wide Hazelcast Settings with the Admin Console
Some Hazelcast configuration settings apply to the whole domain.
Navigate to the _Data Grid page for the domain wide settings.

image::hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-domain-hazelcast-options.png[Data Grid Domain Wide Options]

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols="4,6",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description
|Restart Data Grid |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be
restarted to apply any changes made

|DAS Bind Address|Explicity specifies the IP Address the DAS should bind the Hazelcast instance to.
By default, Hazelcast will try to choose the correct bind address from the IP addresses available
on the host. If you find the DAS is binding to an incorrect IP Address the correct address
can be specified here.

|DAS Public Address|This is the public IP Address that the DAS should use if the DAS is
behind a NAT firewall and other Payara Server Instances need to connect via the public
NAT address rather than the internal IP Address

|Auto Increment Port| By default the cluster uses the next unoccupied port that is available starting with the start port. When auto-increment is turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure instead.

|DAS Start Port | The port the DAS uses to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port
specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.

|Network Interfaces | Similar to DAS Bind address by default Hazelcast will choose the correct
IP Address to bind to. If you find Hazelcast is binding to the incorrect address a comma separated
list of IP Addresses can be specified here.

|Override Configuration File |Specifies the Hazelcast configuration file
to use. The path specified is relative to the domain _config_ directory.

If you are using a custom GlassFish server configuration for a cluster
or standalone instance (e.g. _cluster-config_), then the Hazelcast 
configuration file should be placed in the directory with the same name
(e.g. _<domain-root>/config/cluster-config_). This will ensure it is
replicated to the node during startup.

Using this option to point to a valid Hazelcast configuration file will cause
all other options set to be ignored. Any options unset within the Hazelcast
configuration file will be set to the Hazelcast defaults.

|Data Grid Group Name | Specifies the Hazelcast group name, to be optionally used
 to help divide clusters into logical, segregated groups (i.e. _dev-group_,
   _prod-group_).

|Data Grid Group Password |Specifies the password used to access the Hazelcast
group.

|Start Port|The port the other Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port
specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.

|License Key |Enables
https://hazelcast.com/products/enterprise/[Hazelcast Enterprise]
features.

|Host Aware Partitioning |Whether or not to enable
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#grouping-types[host-aware partitioning]
 for the cluster.
Host aware partitioning *must be* enabled
on all members of the cluster (including Payara Micro instances) for
this feature to work correctly. This is default in Payara Server 5.181 onwards for both
Payara Server domains and Payara Micro instances.

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description

|Enabled | See xref:documentation/payara-server/hazelcast/enable-hazelcast.adoc[Disabling Data Grid] for detailed information

|Restart Data Grid |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be
restarted to apply any changes made

|Lite Data Grid Instance|If set to true, cluster members with this configuration
will be Hazelcast "lite" nodes, meaning they will not store any cache data
locally and rely on other cluster members to store data.
|Config Specific Data Grid Start Port|This is only available since 5.194. Sets Data Grid Start Port to the instance. If set to 0 (default) the Domain wide start port will be used instead.
|Public Address for this Data Grid Node|The Public Address to use for this Data Grid Node. Used when the node is behind a NAT

|Instance Group | Instance group name for all Server Instances using the configuration.
Future functionality may use this name.

|Hazelcast Instance JNDI Name |The JNDI name to bind the Hazelcast instance to.
|JCache Manager JNDI Name| The JNDI name to bind the JCache Cache Manager to.
|JCache Caching Provider JNDI Name|The JNDI name to bind the JCache Caching Provider to.

|Executor Pool Size| The threadpool size for the Hazelcast Executor service
|Executor Queue Capacity | Queue Capacity of the Data Grid Executor Service. Executions are queued until a thread is available
|Scheduled Executor Pool Size| The threadpool size for the Hazelcast Scheduled Executor service
|Scheduled Executor Queue Capacity | Queue Capacity of the Data Grid Scheduled Executor Service. Executions are queued until a thread is available
|====

Enter your required values, and click _Save_. Restarting the domain or
instance/cluster is not necessary for any changes made to take effect, provided
that _"Dynamic"_ remains set to "_true_"

[[configuring-hazelcast-on-domain-creation]]
== Configuring Hazelcast on Domain Creation
_Since Payara Server 5.194 and 5.193.2_

The following options can be used with the `create-domain` command to specify certain Hazelcast settings when a domain is created:

[cols="3,1,4,1,1",options="header"]
|====
|Option|Type|Description|Default|Mandatory

| `--hazelcastdasport` | Port Number | The port to run Hazelcast on for the DAS. 
If this port is busy and auto-increment option is enabled, the port specified 
will be incremented until a valid port is found. The `--hazelcastdasport` 
option cannot be used with the `--portbase` option. The `--hazelcastdasport` 
option overrides the `hazelcast.das.port` property of the `--domainproperties` 
option. | 4900 | No

| `--hazelcaststartport` | Port Number | The port the other Payara Server 
instances use to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy and auto-increment 
option is enabled, the port specified will be incremented until a valid port is 
found. The `--hazelcaststartport` option cannot be used with the `--portbase` 
option. The `--hazelcaststartport` option overrides the hazelcast.start.port 
property of the `--domainproperties` option. | 5900 | No

| `--hazelcastautoincrement` | Boolean | By default the Data Grid uses the next 
unoccupied port that is available starting with the start port. When 
auto-increment is turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure 
instead. The `--hazelcastautoincrement` option overrides the `hazelcast.auto.increment` 
property of the `--domainproperties` option. | 5900 | No
|====

The following domain properties have been added  to the 'create-domain' command 
to make it possible to configure certain Hazelcast setting when a domain is created:


[cols=(,,,,),options="header"]
|====
|Property|Description

| `hazelcast.das.port` | This property specifies the port number of the port the
 DAS use to run Hazelcast on. The `hazelcast.das.port` property is overridden by 
the `--hazelcastdasport` option.

| `hazelcast.start.port` | This property specifies the port number of the port 
the other Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. The hazelcast.start.port 
property is overridden by the `--hazelcaststartport` option.

| `hazelcast.auto.increment` | This property specifies whether or not to use the 
next unoccupied port that is available starting with the start port. When auto-increment 
is turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure instead. The 
hazelcast.auto.increment property is overridden by the `--hazelcastautoincrement` option.
|====

NOTE: If the `portbase` options are used, the values for the ports of the 
Hazelcast DAS start port and the Hazelcast start Port are calculated as follows: 
Hazelcast DAS start port: _portbase_ + 49 and Hazelcast start port: _portbase_ + 59.

*The following examples demonstrate creating a domain with all of the Hazelcast 
related options:*
