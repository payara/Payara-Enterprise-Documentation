[[snmp-notifier]]
= SNMP Notifier

The **S**imple **N**etwork **M**anagement **P**rotocol is a standard Internet
Protocol that was designed to collect and organize information about all
managed devices and services that belong to the same network. *SNMP* is
supported by a huge variety of devices, including network devices like
routers, modems and switches, servers and in the latter years extended
to cover IoT devices and specialized equipment connected to the cloud.

[[snmp-concepts]]
== SNMP Concepts

The basic elements in every SNMP communication are the following:

*Managed Component*::
This is the device or service that is managed and
monitored by SNMP, in this specific case, Payara Server.
*SNMP Agent*::
A specialized software that gathers data on the overall
status of the managed component and exposes specific instructions over
interfaces for its management. In our case, the SNMP Notifier acts as a
SNMP agent.
*SNMP Manager*::
A server machine that runs a network management system, which is
configured to monitor and manage all devices and services in a network
by _"talking"_ to the agents and gathering all relevant information.

The SNMP protocol works using _PDUs (Protocol Data Units)_ in order to
allow managers and agents to work with a defined set of instructions.
The notifier currently operates using the *TRAP* PDU to handle
notification events.

[[snmp-traps]]
=== SNMP Traps

Payara Server Enterprise notifies network management systems using SNMP traps. A
SNMP trap is a special PDU that is used to generate an asynchronous
notification from an _agent_ to a _manager_. An important point to
stress with traps is that they are asynchronous events that can occur at
any time, which means that a _manager_ expects to receive updates in a
*PASSIVE* manner, thus saving resources.

In order to correctly configure Payara Server Enterprise to send traps to a
manager, the following information must be reviewed in tandem with the
configuration of the _manager_:

*Hostname*::
This is the hostname of the server's where the manager software resides.
*Port*::
This is the UDP port where the manager software is receiving SNMP traps.
By default the protocol usually uses port *162*.
*Version*:: The version used by the SNMP trap.
*Community*:: This is the community string used to "secure" the
communication to the manager
*OID*:: The object identifier used by the trap in order to allow the
manager to correctly interpret the status of the server.

[[version]]
=== Version

Currently, the SNMP protocol is supported on three versions: *v1*, *v2c*
and *v3*. Version 1 is extremely unsecure since authentication is
managed only with the community string. Version 2c is an enhanced
version of v1 in that improves the message formats and the protocol
operations, using stronger authentication guards using the simplistic
community string mechanism. Finally, Version 3 improves security and
remote management discarding the use of community strings.

Currently the notifier configuration only supports *v1* and *v2c*, hence
the need to correctly configure a community string as well. By default
all traps are configured to use *v2c*, since it's guaranteed to be
supported by almost all network manager systems.

[[community]]
=== Community

The community string is used to establish trust between managers and
agents. The community names are essentially passwords; most vendors ship
their equipment with default community strings: `public` for a read-only
community (allows reading data values, but doesn't allow modification)
and `private` for the read-write community (allowed to read and modify
data values). It's important to change these defaults on production
environments.

The notifier configures all traps with the `public` community string by
default.

[[oid---object-identifier]]
=== OID - Object Identifier

Agents expose management data as variables composed in a structured
hierarchy. SNMP does not define which variables are exposed by a managed
component. Instead, SNMP uses an extensible design which allows
applications and services to define their own hierarchies and other
metadata (such as type and description of the variable), which are
described in a *Management Information Base (MIB)*. MIBs describe the
structure of the management data of a device subsystem using a
hierarchical namespace composed of Object Identifiers (OID). Each OID
uniquely identifies a variable sent in the SNMP trap by the agent.

In order for a *network management system* to understand a trap sent to
it by an agent, the management system must know what the OID defines.
Therefore, it must have the MIB for that trap loaded in its
configuration.

The default value used by the notification service is
`.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8`. This OID represents a simple octet string that is
used to hold the content of the notification event.

NOTE: In most cases there is no need to change the default OID, since its
verified by most of the standard MIBs included on SNMP management systems
and tools.

[[payara-server-configuration]]
== Payara Server Configuration

To setup the SNMP notifier on Payara Server Enterprise you need to input the values
mentioned earlier in the domain configuration. As usual you can do this
using the administration web console, from the command line or editing
the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

TIP: Keep in mind that the only required value to configure the
notifier is the *hostname* of your network management system. All other
values will assume the defaults discussed earlier if not configured
explicitly.

[[using-the-administration-web-console]]
=== Using the Administration Web Console

To configure the Notification Service in the Administration Console, go
to _Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Notification Service_
and click on the *SNMP* tab:

image:notification-service/snmp/admin-console-configuration.png[Notification Service in Admin Console]

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

To configure the Notification Service from the command line, use the
`set-snmp-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-snmp-notifier-configuration --enabled=true --dynamic=true --hostname=localhost --port=162 --community=public --oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8" --version=v2c
----

You can use the `--enabled` and `--dynamic` options to enable or disable
the SNMP notifier on demand.

Also, you can retrieve the current configuration for the SNMP notifier
using the `get-snmp-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > get-snmp-notifier-configuration
----

This will return the details of the current SNMP configuration; see
below for an example:

[source, shell]
----
Enabled  Noisy  Community  OID                Version  Host       Port
true     false  example    .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8   v2c      127.0.0.1  162
----

[[on-the-domain.xml-configuration-file]]
=== On the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration file,
locate the `notification-service-configuration` element in the tree and
insert the `snmp-notifier-configuration` element with the respective
attributes like this:

[source, xml]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <snmp-notifier-configuration host="localhost" oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8" community="public" version="v2c" enabled="true" port="162"></snmp-notifier-configuration>
</notification-service-configuration>
----

WARNING: Modifying the domain.xml configuration is not a supported configuration
method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the SNMP notifier, it can be used to
push notifications to your configured server. You can visualize the
notification messages on your network management system of your choice.
If you do not see any notification event messages, check the following:

* Is the SNMP notifier enabled?
* Is the Notification Service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the
HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to
observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Does the SNMP network management supports SNMP traps?
* Does the SNMP network management system support the configured
protocol version?
* Is the community string correctly supported by the SNMP network
management system?
* Are the SNMP management system's MIB correctly configured to verify
traps sent with the configured OID?
* Is there a firewall between Payara Server and the network management
system that is correctly configured to allow sending SNMP traps in the
respective port?
