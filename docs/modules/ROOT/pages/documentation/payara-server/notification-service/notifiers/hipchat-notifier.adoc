= HipChat Notifier

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.171_

HipChat is a team chat application created by **Atlassian**. It can be used
for teams to discuss topics in separate "rooms", but also supports
integrations from services to notify users of events.

Payara Server Enterprise has now included functionality to send notifications from
the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification Service]
to a HipChat room

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

To use HipChat as a notification target you must have a HipChat account
and a room where notifications will be sent.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

At a high level, the steps to configure the HipChat notifier are the following:

. In HipChat, create a new notification token for the required room.
. Proceed to configure the notifier on Payara Server

[[hipchat-configuration]]
== HipChat Configuration

Assuming you already have a HipChat account, the steps to create a room
and generate a notification token are as follows:

. Create a new room in HipChat where your notifications will be sent,
if one does not exist. The example below shows the creation of a room
called "_payara-notifications_"

+
After you have created the target room, or if a room already exists, visit
`https://${your-team-name}.hipchat.com/rooms` and search for the room
name to filter out any others, as shown below:
+

. Select your room and select the "*Tokens*" link in the left-hand menu to
add a new notification token:

. Finally, give your token an informative label, since this will be displayed
in your room when notifications are received:

== Payara Server Configuration

Once you have a token, the configuration of the notifier within Payara
Server Enterprise involves just one step. In the Admin Console, simply add the room
name and token to the appropriate fields, as shown below:

image:notification-service/hipchat/admin-console-configuration.png[Configuring Hipchat Notifier on Admin Console]

Make sure that the *Enabled* box is ticked so that the notifier will be
used. If you would like the changes to take effect without needing a
restart, tick the *Dynamic* box as well.

To make these changes using an `asadmin` command use the following command sample,
which mirrors the above screenshot:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> notification-hipchat-configure --enabled=true --roomName="payara-notifications" --token="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" --dynamic=true
----

To check the current applied configuration from asadmin, run the following
command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin get-hipchat-notifier-configuration
----

It will return the current configuration, with whether it is currently
enabled, the room name, and the current token in use:

[source, shell]
----
$ asadmin get-hipchat-notifier-configuration

Enabled         Room Name                 Token
true            payara-notifications      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
----

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the HipChat notifier, it can be used
to push notifications to your configured room. If you do not see any
notifications, check the following:

* Is the HipChat notifier enabled?
* Is the notification service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the
HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to
observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Check that you have not hit the
https://developer.atlassian.com/hipchat/guide/hipchat-rest-api/api-rate-limits[rate limit for the HipChat API]

Once configuring is complete and both the notification service and the
service you are using are enabled, you should see output like the
example, which shows the Healthcheck service outputting CPU information
every _3 seconds_:
