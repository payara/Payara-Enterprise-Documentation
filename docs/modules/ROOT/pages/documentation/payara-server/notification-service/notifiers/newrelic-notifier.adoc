[[newrelic-notifier]]
= New Relic Notifier

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.172_

https://newrelic.com/[New Relic] is an application performance monitoring (APM)
tool that can be used to gather statistics and notify on key critical events
generated by different type of applications. New Relic specializes on integrating
Java application servers like GlassFish, JBoss WildFly, etc. and other application
frameworks seamlessly.

Payara Server Enterprise includes a special notifier to send notifications from the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification service]
to the New Relic **Insights service** using its remote API. Custom notification events
generated from Payara Server's own monitoring systems like the Request Tracing and
Healthcheck services can be automatically identified by this API and gathered correctly
to identify performance issues on the application server.

[[newrelic-integration-configuration]]
== New Relic Configuration

In order for the notifier to work correctly, you must complete the following
requirements:

. Create a New Relic user account. You can signup for a new account https://newrelic.com/signup[here]
+
NOTE: New Relic offers 14-days trial accounts that  can be used to test the service
for free.

. Configure application performance monitoring (APM) for a Payara Server Enterprise instance
by installing a New Relic Java agent
. Configure a New Relic Insights API key that will be used to setup the
notifier.

=== Configure Application Performance Monitoring for Payara Server

The first task is to set up the New Relic Java agent in Payara Server. To do that,
follow these steps:

. Login to New Relic with your account credentials, and if you haven't setup a
monitoring agent yet, the following screen will be shown:
+
image:notification-service/newrelic/agent-setup-1.png[New Relic agent setup welcome screen]

. Select the *Java* option and the agent installation procedure will be shown:
+
image:notification-service/newrelic/agent-setup-2.png[New Relic Java agent setup procedure]
+
From the screen shown, copy the value of the _License Key_ (you need to press the
*Reveal License Key* button first) since you will need it later.

. Now, on the same screen press the *Download the Java Agent*. This will download
the Java agent files to your station. Unzip the files and copy the resulting
folder to the root folder of the Payara Server domain you want to monitor. In the
following example we are copying it to the default domain `domain1`:
+
[source, shell]
----
unzip newrelic-java-3.XX.X.zip
mv newrelic ${PAYARA_INSTALL_DIR}/glassfish/domains/domain1
----

. Before proceeding to install the agent into the Payara Server domain, we need
to configure the License Key we got earlier. To do this, modify the agent's configuration
file that's located at _${PAYARA_DOMAIN_DIR}/newrelic/newrelic.yml_ by using the
`license_key` property:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  # ...
  # This section is for settings common to all environments.
  # Do not add anything above this next line.
  common: &default_settings

    # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
    # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
    # account. ...
    license_key: '073f5089681d0e96d5e0a9691251a626ea90286d'

    # Agent Enabled
    # Use this setting to disable the agent instead of removing it from the startup command.
    # Default is true.
    agent_enabled: true

    # Set the name of your application as you'd like it show up in New Relic.
    # ...
    app_name: Payara Server 4.1.2.172

    # ...
----
+
NOTE: We also recommend setting the name of the application under the `app_name`
property to correctly identify this server's domain on the APM dashboard

+
IMPORTANT: The License Key value must be inserted using single quotes (')

. Now, proceed to install the agent by running the following command at the root
of the domain folder:
+
[source, shell]
----
java -jar newrelic/newrelic.jar install
----
+
If the installation was successful, the output of the agent's installer will show it
like this:
+
[source, shell]
----
***** ( ( o))  New Relic Java Agent Installer
***** Installing version 3.39.1 ...

* Backed up start script to /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/domain.xml.20170613_180108
* Added agent switch to start script /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/domain.xml

* No need to create New Relic configuration file because:
 A config file already exists: /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/newrelic/newrelic.yml

***** Install successful

***** Next steps:
You\'re almost done! To see performance data for your app:

1) Restart your app server
2) Exercise your app
3) Log into http://rpm.newrelic.com

Within two minutes, your app should show up, ready to monitor and troubleshoot.
If app data doesn\'t appear, check newrelic/logs/newrelic_agent.log for errors.
----
+
The installer will modify the domain.xml configuration file of your server's domain
and add the configuration of the Java agent as a JVM start argument:
+
[source, xml]
----
<java-config classpath-suffix="" debug-options="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=9009" system-classpath="">
  <jvm-options>-javaagent:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/newrelic/newrelic.jar</jvm-options>
  <jvm-options>-server</jvm-options>
  ...
</java-config>
----
+
NOTE: The agent setup page has a different set of instructions for Windows and Linux
environments, but they are so similar that the instructions mentioned here should
be sufficient.
+

TIP: If you are considering installing the New Relic Java agent on a Payara Server
standalone instance or a cluster of multiple instances, you need to manually
add the JVM (the installer won't work) option with the `javaagent` configuration
to the instance/cluster referenced configuration. Also, make sure that the directory
where the _newrelic.jar_ resides also contains the _newrelic.yml_ configuration file

. Now that the agent has been installed, start the Payara Server domain.
You will observe the following messages at the start of the domain's log
+
[source, log]
----
INFO: New Relic Agent: Loading configuration file "/opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/newrelic/newrelic.yml"
INFO: New Relic Agent: Writing to log file: /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/newrelic/logs/newrelic_agent.log
...
----

. After some minutes with the server working, you can login back to the New Relic
portal and on the *APM* dashboard you can see a new entry for recently configured
server:
+
image:notification-service/newrelic/apm-dashboard.png[New Relic APM Dashboard]
+
You can also access the latest monitoring statistics:

[[retrieving-api-key]]
=== Retrieving the API Key from New Relic Insights

Now that the agent has been correctly installed, login back to your New Relic account
portal and head to the *Insights* dashboard:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-dashboard.png[New Relic Insights Dashboard]

Access the _Manage Data_ option on the side menu, you will be presented the
following screen:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-api-keys-screen.png[New Relic Insights API Keys]

Click on the `+` icon at the side of the *Insert Keys* header. Take note of the
_Account ID_ and _API Key_ value on this screen. Also add a brief description to
reference this key on the dashboard:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-insert-api-key.png[New Relic Insights Insert API Keys]

[[payara-server-configuration]]
== Payara Server Configuration

With the New Relic Java agent and Insights API Key correctly configured, you can
proceed to configure the New Relic notifier on the Payara Server domain. As usual
you can do this using the administration web console, from the command line or
editing the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

[[using-the-administration-web-console]]
=== Using the Administration Web Console

To configure the Notification Service in the Administration Console, go to
_Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Notification Service_
and click on the *New Relic* tab:

image:notification-service/newrelic/newrelic-admin-console-configuration.png[New Relic Configuration on Admin Console]

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to
restart the domain) and input the New Relic Account ID and the newly inserted
Insights API Key. Hit the *Save* button to preserve the changes.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

To configure the Notification Service from the command line, use the
`set-newrelic-notifier-configuration` asadmin command, specifying the tokens
like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-newrelic-notifier-configuration --dynamic=true --enabled=true --accountId=1658989 --key=b5815wdxj6lF_tmMBljQa5y1603JTiLh
----

You can use the `--enabled` and `--dynamic` options to enable or disable
the New Relic notifier on demand.

Also, you can retrieve the current configuration for the New Relic notifier
using the `get-newrelic-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > get-newrelic-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Noisy  Key                               Account Id
true     true   b5815wdxj6lF_tmMBljQa5y1603JTiLh  1658989
----

[[on-the-domain.xml-configuration-file]]
=== In the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration
file, locate the `notification-service-configuration` element in the
tree and insert the `newrelic-notifier-configuration` with the respective
attributes like this:

[source, xml]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <new-relic-notifier-configuration account-id="1658989" key="b5815wdxj6lF_tmMBljQa5y1603JTiLh" enabled="true"></new-relic-notifier-configuration>
</notification-service-configuration>
----

WARNING: Modifying the domain.xml configuration is not a supported configuration
method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the New Relic notifier, it can be used observe
notification events on the New Relic Insights service dashboard .
If you do not see any notification event messages on the data explorer, check the
following:

* Is the New Relic notifier enabled?
* Is the Notification Service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the
HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to
observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Is the *Java Agent* for your Payara Server's domain correctly configured?
* Have you created a valid API Key for the Insights service?
* Does your account ID and the Insights API key match the ones configured on the
Payara Server notifier?

Here's a sample of how these notifications are visualized on the Data Explorer
dashboard for the New Relic Insights service:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-data-explorer-results.png[New Relic Insights Data Explorer]

You can observe that the events are correctly identified depending the severity
of the notification and they are correctly grouped by their custom category (in
the image only the *Healthcheck* events are shown).
