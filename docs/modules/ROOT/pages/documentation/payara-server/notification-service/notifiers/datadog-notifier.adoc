= Datadog Notifier

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.172_

https://www.datadoghq.com[Datadog] is a cloud metric aggregator that simplifies
the gathering and visualization of multiple platform stacks and services that can be
on premises or on the cloud. Datadog also eases browsing through of all this
information by implementing combination graphs (multiple graphs that can be configured
on a single view) of related metrics.

Datadog support gathering metrics from the following sources:

* Cloud Providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform)
* Message Queues (Apache Kafka, ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ)
* Code Repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket)
* Clustering and DevOps Tools (Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker)
* Web Servers (Apache HTTP, NGinx, LightHTTP)
* SQL and NoSQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CouchBase)
* Monitoring Solutions (New Relic, Nagios, Splunk, Amazon Cloud Trail)

Payara Server includes a special notifier to send notifications from the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification service]
to a Datadog account by means of an API key.

[[slack-integration-configuration]]
== Datadog Account Integration

When you create a Data Dog account, the service will provide you a default API key
that you can use to integrate Payara Server with your account.

NOTE: You can signup for a free trial account (14 days) if you want to test this
integration without having to worry about a permanent subscription.

Here are the instructions to retrieve the API keys:

. First, access the Datadog administration panel located at
https://app.datadoghq.com/. Then, in the side menu select the _Integrations_ ->
_APIs_ option:
+

. On the APIs tab you will observe the default API Key available for integration:
+

+
You can also create a new API key if you want to use it exclusively for your Payara
Server installation.

. Assign a name to the default API key or a newly created key, so you can identify
which services or platform stacks are integrating with Datadog other than your Payara
Server installation:

[[payara-server-configuration]]
== Payara Server Configuration

Having retrieved the API key from Datadog's administration panel, it's necessary
to configure this key to the notification service on Payara Server. It's possible
to do this either by using the administration web console, from the command line
using administration commands or by modifying the _domain.xml_ configuration file
directly.

[[using-the-administration-web-console]]
=== Using the Administration Web Console

To configure the Notification Service in the Administration Console, go
to _Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] ->
Notification Service_ and click on the *Datadog* tab:

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to
restart the domain) and input the three tokens highlighted in the
previous section. Hit the *Save* button to preserve the changes.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

To configure the Notification Service from the command line, use the
`notification-datadog-configure` asadmin command, specifying the tokens
like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > notification-datadog-configure --dynamic=true --key=af510f122026bc9107f7c5f4f049e597 --enabled=true
----

You can use the `--enabled` and `--dynamic` options to enable or disable
the Datadog notifier on demand.

Also, you can retrieve the current configuration for the Datadog notifier
using the `get-datadog-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > get-datadog-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Key
true     af510f122026bc9107f7c5f4f049e597
----

[[on-the-domain.xml-configuration-file]]
=== On the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration
file, locate the `notification-service-configuration` element in the
tree and insert the `datadog-notifier-configuration` with the respective
attributes like this:

[source, xml]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
  <log-notifier-configuration enabled="true"></log-notifier-configuration>
  <datadog-notifier-configuration enabled="true" key="af510f122026bc9107f7c5f4f049e597"></datadog-notifier-configuration>
</notification-service-configuration>
----

WARNING: Modifying the _domain.xml_ configuration is not a supported configuration
method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the Datadog notifier, Datadog can gather relevant
monitoring events from your Payara Server installation. If you do not see any
notification event messages on your Datadog account, check the following:

* Is the Datadog notifier enabled?
* Is the Notification Service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the
HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to
observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Does the configured API key on Payara Server match one of the API keys
configured on your Datadog account?

Here's a sample of how the notifications are visualized on the Datadog
event notification panel (on the side menu select the _Event_ option):
