= Notification Service

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.163_

Payara Server comes with a general Notification
service in order to log events which come from other services, such as
the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/jmx-monitoring-service/jmx-monitoring-service.adoc[JMX Monitoring Service], the xref:/documentation/payara-server/health-check-service/README.adoc[HealthCheck service] or the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/request-tracing-service/request-tracing-service.adoc[Request Tracing service].

The Notification service provides the ability to disseminate
notification events through various channels that are being created by
other services. This service is provided with a number of configurable
_notifiers_, the default being a log notification mechanism which can be
seen in the following `domain.xml` snippet:

[source, shell]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <log-notifier-configuration enabled="true" />
</notification-service-configuration>
----

The main configuration tag `notification-service-configuration` has only
one attribute: `enabled`, which can be set to either `true` or
`false`. This provides the ability to globally enable or disable all
configured notifiers.

The `<log-notifier-configuration>` tag registers a log notifier to the
pub-sub model of the notification service where it subscribes to each
log notification event that would get published by another service.

The Notification service can be configured through the admin console:
