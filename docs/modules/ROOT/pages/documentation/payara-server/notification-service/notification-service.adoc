= Notification Service

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.163_

Payara Server Enterprise comes with a general Notification
service in order to log events which come from other services, such as
the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/jmx-monitoring-service/jmx-monitoring-service.adoc[JMX Monitoring Service], the xref:/documentation/payara-server/health-check-service/README.adoc[HealthCheck service] or the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/request-tracing-service/request-tracing-service.adoc[Request Tracing service].

The Notification service provides the ability to disseminate
notification events through various channels that are being created by
other services. This service is provided with a number of configurable
_notifiers_, the default being the Log Notifier.

The Notification service can be configured using the xref:documentation/payara-server/notification-service/asadmin-commands.adoc[Asadmin tool] or through the admin console:
