= Firing and Listening for remote CDI Events

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.171 (Full Edition), 4.1.2.172 (Web Edition) & Payara Micro 4.1.153_

Payara Server is able to listen to and fire CDI events across the
Hazelcast cluster. The CDI events can be fired and listened to by
applications on Payara Server instances as well as Payara Micro
instances provided that they are connected to the same cluster.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

Hazelcast must be enabled for all Payara Server instances and they must be able to connect to the same Hazelcast cluster. See the xref:documentation/payara-server/hazelcast/README.adoc[Data Grid] section for more details.


[[initializing-the-event-bus]]
== Initializing the event bus

The event bus is initialized automatically after an application is
started. No additional configuration is necessary to fire and listen to
remote events.

[[firing-remote-cdi-events]]
== Firing remote CDI events

In order to fire a CDI event remotely, mark it with the `@Outbound`
annotation:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@fish.payara.micro.cdi.Outbound
Event<String> event;
----

The above will create an event with a String payload, which will be
observable on remote instances in the cluster.

An outbound event can be fired as any other CDI event:

[source, java]
----
event.fire("This is an event");
----

The payload passed as an argument to the `fire()` method has to
implement the `Serializable` interface.

An outbound event will be fired asynchronously on a remote instance. If
xref:#loopback[loopback] is allowed, it will be fired also on the same
instance, but in a different thread. Therefore the call doesn't block
the current thread.

TIP: Since Payara Version 4.1.2.172, it's possible to use additional qualifiers to match
event with observers. Any additional qualifier used with `@Outbound`
will mean that the event will be matched with an `@Inbound` listener that accepts the qualifiers.

[[observing-remote-cdi-events]]
== Observing remote CDI events

Outbound events are observed by every CDI bean with a listener method
that is marked with the `@Inbound` qualifier:

[source, java]
----
public void receiveEvent(@Observes @Inbound String message) {
}
----

The observers may reside in any application running on one or more
instances in a Hazelcast cluster, and they will listen to events fired
in an application running on any instance within the same cluster. By
default, events will be fired on all remote cluster instances (all
instances except the one in which the event was fired).

An event will be matched with observers by the payload class, using the
same rules as usual CDI events. Observers will receive events that are
assignable to the observed class.

== Additional options

[[qualifiers]]
=== Using CDI Qualifiers

_Since Payara Version 4.1.2.172_

It's possible to tag a remote event in a type-safe way using any 
CDI qualifier. Only observers that match the qualifiers would receive 
such event.

A remote event with a qualifier `@MyQualifier` can be triggered like this:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@fish.payara.micro.cdi.Outbound
@MyQualifier
Event<String> event;
...
event.fire("This is a qualified event");
----

This event can be observed only by an observer that contains the qualifier:

[source, java]
----
public void receiveEvent(@Observes @Inbound @MyQualifier String message) {
}
----

[[event-name]]
=== Event name

It is possible to tag a remote event with a name. In that case, only
observers that listen to events of the same name will receive such
events.

To fire an event with a name:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@Outbound(eventName = "MyEvent")
Event<String> event;
----

To receive the above named event:

[source, java]
----
public void receiveEvent(@Observes @Inbound("MyEvent") String message) {
}
----

[[instance-name]]
=== Instance name

By default, all remote instances in the same cluster will receive an
outbound event, which matches the observed class and event name. If you
want to target specific instances in the cluster, it is possible to
define one or more target instances for an outbound event:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@Outbound(instanceName = "Instance-1")
Event<String> event;
----

Several instance names can be configured with an array:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@Outbound(instanceName = {"Instance-1", "Instance-2"})
Event<String> event;
----

If you are using Payara Server, the name of the DAS instance is `server`
by default. In the case of a separate standalone instance, use the
instance's name in the configuration. If you are using Payara Micro, the
instance's name is configured using the `--name` option, or is generated
by if not configured (see the section xref:/documentation/payara-micro/configuring/instance-names.adoc[Payara Micro Instance
Names]).

[[loopback]]
=== Loopback

When an outbound event is fired, by default, it is treated as a remote
message and will be delivered only to remote instances in the cluster.
It will not be delivered to listeners on the same server instance.

If an event should be delivered to observers in the local instance as
well, it can be done by setting the `loopBack` attribute to true:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@Outbound(loopBack = true)
Event<String> event;
----

[[dynamic-configuration]]
== Dynamic configuration

If required, events can also be fired programmatically, not only
using the static `@Outbound` annotation next to the injection point.
Although there is no special API to support it, CDI already supports
programmatic configuration of events.

The following is an example of how to configure and fire an outbound
event programmatically without using any injection points:

[source, java]
----
CDI.current().getBeanManager().fireEvent("This is an event", new Outbound() {
    @Override
    public String eventName() {
        return System.getProperty("eventname");
    }

    @Override
    public boolean loopBack() {
        return Boolean.getBoolean(System.getProperty("loopback"));
    }

    @Override
    public String instanceName() {
        return System.getProperty("instanceName");
    }

    @Override
    public Class<? extends Annotation> annotationType() {
        return this.getClass();
    }
});
----

The above code creates a dynamic instance of the
`@Outbound` annotation and fires the event `"This is an event"`
using a bean manager retrieve via a static `CDI.current`()` method.
