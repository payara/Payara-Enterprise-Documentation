Payara Server comes with Zendesk integration for paid support customers. This
means that customers can raise and manage tickets through Zendesk from the
Payara administration console. The support page is accessible from the panel
on the left of the admin console, just below the configurations.

You can filter the tickets by their ID or subject by typing in the [green]*filter text
box*. Alternatively you can filter by status by selecting an option from
the [blue]*dropdown* on the right. You can also view either your own personal
tickets by selecting 'User' from the [fuchsia]*button group*, or all tickets from
your company by selecting 'Organization'.

To create a ticket, click the orange plus in the top right of the window.

screen.

=== Creating Tickets

When you click on the button to create a ticket, you will be greeted with the
ticket creation menu. There are fields for the following:
====
Required fields are followed by an asterisk (*).
====

* Subject* - a brief summary of the ticket, or it's topic.
* Description* - A more detailed description of the ticket. Here you will
explain the problem with as much detail as you can.
* Type [Question/Incident/Problem/Task] - This is the category of the ticket.
For example, a question would be for when there is something which you don't
know how to do, but isn't a bug with Payara Server itself.
* Environment* - Is the server being used in production or for development?
* Priority* - Is a button displaying slightly strangely or is the server
throwing ugly exceptions left right and centre?
* Payara Version* - The version of Payara which this ticket relates to.

[[attachments]]
==== Attachments

You can attach relevant files to the ticket. For example, if it's
a configuration issue or question, you may want to attach the domain log. You
can always attach them later if they're asked for. Just click on one of the
buttons and the correct file will automatically be created (if applicable) and
uploaded.

You can also edit an attached *domain.xml*. You would do this, for example, if
there is context sensitive data that needs to be obfuscated.
