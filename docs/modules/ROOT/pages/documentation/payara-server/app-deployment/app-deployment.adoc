= Application Deployment

Applications can be deployed to Payara Server in the same way as 
_GlassFish Server 4.1 Open Source Edition_. Payara Server Enterprise does not modify
this process but does add some new features.

== Deploying on Server Start
GlassFish has had the ability to deploy applications on server start for a long
time now, using the _autodeploy_ directory. While acceptable in development
environments, the scanner used to deploy files in this directory is a security
risk for production and is therefore disabled in the `production` domain bundled with
Payara Server.

To reintroduce the capability of deploying an application on server startup
without the risk of enabling the deployment scanner, a feature from Payara Micro
was introduced: the ability to run asadmin commands at startup, either pre or
post boot.

To enable this feature, we have extended the `start-domain` feature to accept
two extra options: `--prebootcommandfile` and `--postbootcommandfile` which can
be used as follows:

*Pre-boot Commands*::
*Usage*: `asadmin> start-domain --prebootcommandfile=/path/to/file`
+
*Aim*: passing a list of commands as a file to the server to run pre-boot.
Due to the time during boot when the commands in this file are executed, this
only supports `set` commands.

*Post-boot Commands*::
*Usage*: `asadmin> start-domain --postbootcommandfile=/path/to/file`
+
*Aim*: passing a list of commands as a file to the server to run post-boot.
This is where commands such as service configuration commands should be run.

[NOTE]
====
There are some important caveats to note:

* Both files should be saved in a text format, with each command on it's own line.
* Lines where the first non-whitespace character is # are treated as comments
* Any blank lines will be ignored
* Any invalid or failing commands will be logged to the server.log and the file will continue to be processed
* The files *_must_* exist, and be accessible from Payara Server.
* Both pre-boot and post-boot files can be passed at the same time.
====

== Deploying to a Server Already Started
To deploy via the CLI once the server has already started, use the 'deploy' asadmin command.

*Usage*: `asadmin> deploy /path/to/file`
All of the glassfish deploy options apply.

*Payara Specific Options*::
*--skipdsfailure* _(Since Payara Server 4.1.2.173)._  This option will skip over a datasource failure. This means an application can be deployed with a datasource set up, but the database need not be running at the time. Without this option the deployment would fail if a datasource is defined and the database is not available.

*Example*: `asadmin> deploy --skipdsfailure /home/mark/clusterjsp-1.1.war`


== Deploying from a URL
Payara Embedded has the ability to deploy applications from a URL for a while, and this feature has now been brought into Payara Server. To facilitate this new feature, a new asadmin command was created: `deploy-remote-archive`. This command takes all of the same parameters as the standard deploy command, and is used in exactly the same way - the only difference is in the command name, and the fact you specify a URL instead of a file.

*Usage*: `asadmin> deploy-remote-archive _url_`

*Example*: `asadmin> deploy-remote-archive https://raw.github.com/Pandrex247/Payara_PatchedProjects/Payara-Maven-Deployer/fish/payara/testing/clusterjsp/1.1/clusterjsp-1.1.war`

[NOTE]
====
At this point in time, the command will only accept HTTP and HTTPS URLs.
====

== Deploying from a Maven Repository.
The feature of Payara Micro to deploy applications from a Maven Repository using their Group, Artefact, Version (GAV) coordinates has also been brought into Payara Server Enterprise. This functionality uses the same command as when deploying from a URL: `deploy-remote-archive`. This command takes all of the same parameters as the standard deploy command, but has an extra parameter:

* `additionalRepositories` - This parameter accepts a comma separated list of repository URLs, that will be probed when searching for an artefact. By default, the command will only look in Maven Central.

*Usage*: `asadmin> deploy-remote-archive --additionalRepositories repo1,repo2,...,repoN groupId,artefactId,versionNumber`

*Examples*:  

* `asadmin> deploy-remote-archive --additionalRepositories https://google.co.uk,https://raw.github.com/Pandrex247/Payara_PatchedProjects/Payara-Maven-Deployer fish.payara.testing,clusterjsp,1.1`  
* `asadmin> deploy-remote-archive --additionalRepositories https://raw.github.com/Pandrex247/Payara_PatchedProjects/Payara-Maven-Deployer fish.payara.testing,clusterjsp,1.1`  
* `asadmin> deploy-remote-archive --target instance1 fish.payara.testing,clusterjsp,1.1`

If you don't specify a name or context root for the artefact when deploying using GAV coordinates, it will just be the artefact name (in the example above, it would be clusterjsp).

[NOTE]
====
If an application matching the GAV coordinates exists on multiple repositories, the first found will be deployed. The order that the repositories are searched is the order that you specify them in. For example, given an _additionalRepositories_ of _repo1,repo2_, the order that the repositories would be searched is: Maven Central > repo1 > repo2.

Although the command accepts Maven GAV coordinates, it does not actually make use of Maven, and so artefacts will not be saved into your local maven repository.
====

== Overwriting the Application Name

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.182 and 5.182_

When deploying an application or a module on Payara Server Enterprise from an IDE (like 
**NetBeans** or **IntelliJ**), the IDE deploys to Payara Server using the asadmin 
deploy command, with the --name option specified. This will force the application 
or module to have the specified name over the name defined in deployment 
descriptor. This is undesired because the IDE usually infers the application or 
module name from the name of the project or the package file and doesn’t take 
the correct name of the application or module into account.

To solve the issue, application or module name defined in the deployment 
descriptor will **always** take precedence over the `--name` option. But you use
the `--name` and `--forcename` options to override this behaviour. 

NOTE: Prior to 4.1.2.182 and 5.182 `--forcename` option was only supported on EJB.
