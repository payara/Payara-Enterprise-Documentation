= Default Thread Pool Size

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.164_

The thread pool `thread-pool-1` starts with a minimum size of *2*
instead of *1* (like in previous versions)

This includes the benefit of allowing users to execute tasks
concurrently using the `ManagedExecutorService` and
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` components included with Java EE
Concurrency Utilities (https://jcp.org/ja/jsr/detail?id=236[JSR-236]).
Without this change, new tasks submitted to these service components
would just have been queued in a linear fashion.

This minor optimization is configured on the _default domain_ template
(so all newly created domains inherit it) and is also included in the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/production-ready-domain.adoc[Production
Ready] domain template as well, across all profiles (Full, Web, Embedded
and Micro).
