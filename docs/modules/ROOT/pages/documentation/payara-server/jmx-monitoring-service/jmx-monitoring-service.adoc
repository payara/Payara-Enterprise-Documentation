= JMX Monitoring Service

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.163_

Payara offers a custom JMX Monitoring Service. Once configured, Payara
Server Enterprise will monitor and log the values of attributes that have been listed
for monitoring. The metrics are logged together in a single log message as
a series of key-value pairs prefixed by the string `JMX-MONITORING:`.

IMPORTANT: Payara uses the AMX API for working with _JMX MBeans_. AMX is not fully
exposed by default and as such needs to be loaded to access most _JMX MBean_
objects. The JMX Monitoring Service can be used without AMX but
there is a limit to what can be monitored without it.
