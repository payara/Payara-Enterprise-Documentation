== Command Autocompletion

_Since *5.184*&nbsp;_

When running the `asadmin` utility, command autocompletion is supported similar to that found in the bash linux utility. To use this, run `asadmin` without any arguments. Any commands entered from this prompt can be autocompleted by tapping the `<Tab>` key.

Alternatively, you can generate a bash autocompletion file to allow autocompletion without entering the `asadmin` prompt. To find out more, xref:/documentation/payara-server/asadmin-commands/misc-commands.adoc#generate-bash-autocomplete-command[read the documentation here].
